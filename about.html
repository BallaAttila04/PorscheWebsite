                <h2>History of Porsche 930</h2>
                <p>The Porsche 930 has its roots in the 911 platform, which was originally introduced in the early
                    1960s. The Turbo variant emerged as a response to the increasing demand for high-performance sports
                    cars. Launched in 1975, the 930 featured a rear-engine layout, distinctive wide bodywork, and a
                    prominent "whale tail" rear spoiler. Over the years, the 930 underwent various updates, making it a
                    sought-after classic among enthusiasts.</p>

                <h2>The Engine</h2>
                <p>The heart of the Porsche 930 is its powerful and groundbreaking engine. The early models were
                    equipped with a 3.0-liter, air-cooled, turbocharged flat-six engine, delivering a potent mix of
                    power and responsiveness. As the years progressed, the engine capacity increased, with later models
                    featuring a 3.3-liter variant. The turbocharging technology not only enhanced performance but also
                    contributed to the car's distinctive character, marked by the exhilarating turbo lag and a surge of
                    power when the turbo kicked in.</p>
